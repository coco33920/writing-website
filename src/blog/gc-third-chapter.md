# Third chapter finished and edited 

## Third chapter {#third}
The third chapter, _Chapter III: Encounter_, is finished, and edited. I sent it to the
alpha-readers for their thoughts on it. 

You can guess what happens based on the title ;).

My favourite quote of the day 

> Sylvia and Arianaâ€™s minds were blown away.

It's a little on the short side (closer to 2,500 words rather than the 3,000
words target) but I didn't want to write more. So stay tuned for _Chapter IV:
Revelations_
