# First chapter wrote and edited :)

## First chapter { #first }

I finished the first chapter! 
I finished and edited the first chapter, _Chapter I: Mistakes_.
I sent it to the alpha readers for first impressions and corrections.

My favourite quote is undeniably 

> Little did they know it was only the beginning of weird things in their lives.

Follow me in my journey :)
