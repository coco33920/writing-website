# Second chapter finished!

## Second chapter {#2nd}

I finished the second chapter, _in which_ coming out happens, and aliens are
***confused***.

It took me approximately 10 days to finish this chapter, it was a pretty
difficult chapter to write, so I'm confident the next one will take less time!

Stick around to see the sneak peak.

## Sneak peak {#sneak}

My favourite sentence of this chapter is the following one:
 
> But no, they just looked at their bodies, how incompetent!

Our favourite alien is _very_ confused indeed!

## About the multi-language support {#multi}

Yeah, last blog post I said I was starting to implement multi-language support
inside SJ's framework. Unfortunately I tried and it would require a non-trivial
amount of re-writing the code, it _could_ be done, but it would be also _very
useless_ and instead I could hard-code the french translation in the framework.

So yeah I'm dropping the idea of implementing automatic multi-language support. 
I have other plans, regarding [calc](https://github.com/vanilla-extract/calc)
which can keep me busy!
