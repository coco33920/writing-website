# Second chapter almost finished!
## Sneak peak {#sneak}

Hey :)
I have a sneakpeak for you, I almost finished the second chapter, in which,
*things* happens.

## BLAHAJ {#blahaj}

An appearence of our favourite plushy
```
Next to the dresser stood a giant plushy, she recognised the classic trans icon, 
it was the IKEA shark plushy, well it was IKEAâ€™s shark plushy back when IKEA was a thing. 
The company filed for bankruptcy not long after the creation of the ER and the state providing 
apartments, homes, and furniture. The IP of the shark was now owned by a non-profit mostly run by 
Trans folx, they sold the plushies and derivatives at a much better price, and in different sizes too. 
Beth must have bought her the plushy to cheer her up. And it was working, she smiled softly.
```

## Multi-language support {#language}
I feel confident enough to modify the `rust` code which builds the static
website to implement multi language support. It won't be implemented here,
the book is in English, so no sense having a website in French. But it will be
useful for my [website](https://www.charlotte-thomas.me) which also use SJ's
framework.

I opened a tracking
[issue](https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/website/issues/2) on my repo of my
website if you want to follow it!
