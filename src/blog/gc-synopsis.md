# Galactic Consequences

## General {#general} 

Hey! Welcome to the first post on _GC_. This book has been on my mind for.. a
long time! I first started with _A Galactic HRT_ three years ago, but I never
managed to finish it.

Now this book is a revamped version of _AGH_ with a much better grammar and
level of language, proper alpha/beta readers, and a proper cover (I swear! I'll
commission an artist to do the cover and back-cover) 

The PDF and Web Novel will be, and ***always will be*** free of any charges and
distributed under the _CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0_ license.

## Synopsis {#synopsis}

I will share the synopsis with you ;)
